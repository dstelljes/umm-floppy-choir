#UMM Floppy Choir  
####Our goal is to build a floppy choir and develop a full stack of software to interact with it. 

Presently, the floppy choir is composed of several floppy disk, powered by a standard computer 
power supply, and controlled by an aurdino. We will build several sub-choirs that follow this model.

Above the hardware, we have a RaspberryPi that we intend to use as a controller for all of the sub-choirs. It 
communicates by sending serial to each of the aurdinos. The RaspberryPi will also act as a web server. Presenlty we 
are running a Node server and are working on an angular front end.

Once it is done, we want to put it in the Computer Science display, here at the University of Minnesota, Morris.
